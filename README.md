# Kids Music Player

Code for my contactless music player for kids, which I built in 2016 with a Raspberry Pi and an RFID card reader. The player uses [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/) (Music Player Daemon) and a simple shell script for reading RFID cards and handling audio playback. Button presses are sent to the Raspberry Pi via infrared using [lirc](https://lirc.org).
