#
# Initial test configuration for systemwide irexec service.
#
# Note that the system-wide service is useful only in corner-cases.
# Most scenarios are better off with a session service as described in the
# Configuration Guide. However, note that both can also be combined.
#
# Also note that the system-wide service runs without a terminal. To
# check the output generated use something like
# 'journalctl -b0 /usr/bin/irexec'. This service just echoes some keys
# commonly available.
